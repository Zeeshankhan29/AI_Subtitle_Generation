1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I used to live my life a quarter mile at a time.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But things changed.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My father now, I will always be in your heart.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Little Brian, I have a gift for you.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Your daddy gave me this.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No, I'm going to give it to you.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's very special.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's for protection from what's coming.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Alright Dom, what's next?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No matter how fast you are.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No one outruns their past.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And mine, just caught up to me for a long time now.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ex-tabit-la!

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we're up against a master thief, assassin, high-performance driver.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who is he?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Jacob is Dom's brother.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Your whole life you pushed yourself to be faster than Dom.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Smarter than Dom.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Stronger than Dom.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But could you kill him?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Because I'm ready if you are.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's nothing more powerful than the love affair, mate.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But you turn that into anger, there's nothing more dangerous.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Maybe this is the end, but we're going to go out together.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know I'd ride to the death with you.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's get to work.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Please tell me that's not a Pontiac Fiera. Strap to a rocket engine?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Impressive, I know.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, no that's not impressive.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:40,000
My ass is in play though!

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I came here to take you down, little brother.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's your mistake. This is my world.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Damn, they got a magnet plane?

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hold on.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Tell me you're not thinking what I think you're thinking.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There's no bridge!

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, hell no.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hey guys.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Surprise.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Nice clubhouse.
