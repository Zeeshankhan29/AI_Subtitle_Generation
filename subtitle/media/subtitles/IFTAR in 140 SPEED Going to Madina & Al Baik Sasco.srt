1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
We will leave without listening to the Azan and watch the time without you.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,760
Look at the car's ticket.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,740
Because we are going to Medina now.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,600
And the challenge for us today is that we have to leave on the highway.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
And remember to take the khujur from the car.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,300
What a great thing.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,640
That day, the khujur that Majid brother brought,

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,040
Majid brother will meet us again today.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040
So, Aslam o alaikum wa rahmatullah wa baraka'atuh.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,040
I am Abdul Malik Fareed with Mamu Sameer and Moiz.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,500
I am Madina Chaloo, I am Madina Chaloo.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
This is the house of the Prophet.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I am there.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,500
O my Mola, listen to me.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Since when have you been waiting for this heart?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Today, we have decided that we will leave without listening to the Azan and watch the time without you.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
We will watch the time without listening to the Azan.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That is because the real way of sunset is the time of Maghrib prayer.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Then, inshaAllah, we will leave everyday and we will show you that the sun must have been set.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,000
And today's our departure will be at the speed of 140.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And here, the legal speed is of 140.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Which goes from Makkah to Medina.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,500
The sun has almost set.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I can see the sun's light for a moment.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Let's cross the mountain and confirm it.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Then, we will leave everyday.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
In Saudi Arabia, the sun is a bit visible.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Especially in the mountainous area, it is hidden behind the mountain.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
The sun has set.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Only the red light is visible.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
So, it is time for our departure.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
In the name of Allah.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Thank you.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Let's confirm it.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
The sun has set.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Today's departure is at the speed of 140.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
InshaAllah.

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Bismillah.

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Now, we have stopped here at the sasco.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
This is in front of you.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
We will have Albaik.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Uncle is going to get the petrol.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Till then, the petrol will be added.

44
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
You also do something.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
They are adding petrol.

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I will eat it.

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Yes, this is the guest's food.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I thought that Albaik will be up and down.

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
It will be up and down.

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Now, the Albaik people have said that they will take 20 minutes to make fresh.

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Till then, let's take some water, some lentils.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Here you go, guest.

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
You can take whatever you want.

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
How will you keep it?

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Keep whatever you want.

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
No, you can't.

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Let's take Laban.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Laban is mango.

59
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Mango?

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Yes.

61
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Will it be a wedding?

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Will it be sweet?

63
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Of course, it will be sweet.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Let it be.

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I am looking for some juice.

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
This is good water.

67
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
3 water has come.

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
What else to take?

69
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
This is a big Laban.

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
This is a small Laban.

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
This is a sweet one.

72
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Laban is over.

73
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
The time for the Eftar is over.

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
We will drink this.

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Mango and I like this.

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Keep it here.

77
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Peace be upon you.

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
What is your name?

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
What is your name?

80
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
What is your name?

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
My name is Zeeshan.

82
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Zeeshan?

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Yes.

84
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
You watch the vlog?

85
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Yes.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Our drinks have come.

87
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
We are hungry because of this.

88
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
We have taken 3 drinks.

89
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
One juice, one water and one lassi.

90
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Mango Laban.

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
This is the park behind this al-baik.

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
We sit here often.

93
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
And we will sit here today.

94
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Since we have taken this from Abdul Rahman.

95
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
We have not taken it back.

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
You will get the answer.

97
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
We have made 4 videos like this.

98
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
We give our friends your chance.

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Let's go.

100
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Our Moiz brother said that he wants to eat a burger.

101
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Yes.

102
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Give him a burger.

103
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Let's leave him alone.

104
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Let's go.

105
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Go.

106
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Who are you?

107
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
This is your burger.

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
This is not good.

109
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
You said that you want to eat a burger.

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
This is a double patty burger.

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
The burger that was in the picture was 2 kg.

112
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
They all look like big burgers.

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
They are big.

114
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I am dead.

115
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
What should we do?

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
You are responsible for this.

117
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I will give you one negative.

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I will take one by one.

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
One by one.

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I will not give you one by one.

121
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You will get one by one.

122
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
You are not making the decision of the cats.

123
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Moiz, eat whatever you want.

124
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
But don't stop us from eating burgers.

125
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I mean eat burgers first.

126
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Eat.

127
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't stop us from eating burgers.

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
This is cheese.

129
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
The weather is cool here.

130
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
It is very cold.

131
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I am hungry today.

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
The nuggets are also delicious.

133
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
We have taken two burgers and two nuggets.

134
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
We will take 10 pieces.

135
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
We will be full.

136
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I have brought this cheese.

137
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Especially this one.

138
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Don't serve it.

139
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
No.

140
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
This is called normal.

141
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
And this is according to the normal.

142
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
It is so cold.

143
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
We will meet you in Madina.

144
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
How is the food?

145
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
First time seeing the food.

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
It is different.

147
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
It is a little less.

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
He doesn't let us hear.

149
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
You get connected.

150
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Alhamdulillah, we came here after saying hello.

151
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
We are about to drink Zamzam.

152
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
But there is another story in Zamzam.

153
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
This is our Moiz.

154
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
We came here for the first time.

155
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
It was the first time when we had Umrah.

156
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Yes.

157
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
We didn't get the food.

158
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
We didn't get the food.

159
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
We came to Madina and immediately after the Al-Azizaharad.

160
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Yes.

161
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
What a thing.

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Alhamdulillah.

163
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
When we come here, we say hello.

164
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
And we come to the mosque.

165
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
We pray.

166
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
We get so much peace.

167
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Which is not possible in words.

168
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I thought for a long time.

169
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
I thought for a long time.

170
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I thought that I could give an example of this.

171
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
But I couldn't give an example.

172
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
I thought for a long time.

173
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,500
I came here to give an example of peace.

174
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
When you keep your mother's burden.

175
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
How do you feel peace?

176
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
But it is more than that.

177
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I didn't understand that.

178
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I didn't understand that this is also an example.

179
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
What is the reason for giving an example?

180
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Alhamdulillah.

181
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Now, when you see in the video.

182
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
You must feel so peace.

183
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
But in fact, it is much more than that.

184
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
The more you see in the video.

185
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It is much more than that.

186
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I just pray to Allah.

187
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
All the people who are watching this.

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
May Allah give them a lot of peace.

189
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
This is a prayer from my heart.

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Look, here is a special place for special people.

191
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
It is kept near the door.

192
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You enter from here.

193
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,500
The special people are given a place here.

194
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
That is, no one else is allowed to sit here.

195
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
The wheel chairs are standing here.

196
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
That is a special person.

197
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Alhamdulillah, the visit has also taken place.

198
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
In Masjid-e-Nabwi.

199
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Which Allah has given a gift.

200
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Alhamdulillah, it has gone.

201
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
And today's video ends here.

202
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Alhamdulillah, Madinatul-Munawra is here.

203
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Some people will go to Madinatul-Munawra.

204
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Some people will go to the malls.

205
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
What a place of peace.

206
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Alhamdulillah, Allah has given a gift.

207
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Come here.

208
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
And for you all, many prayers are for me.

209
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
From my side.

210
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
May Allah give you the best of the world.

211
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
I will show you my love in videos.

212
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
As always.

213
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
And InshaAllah, I will meet you in the next video.

214
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Allah Hafiz.
