1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,840
Outfit X is a private terror group

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,240
which doesn't work for any purpose.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,040
They work on contracts.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,320
Ma'am, we have a red flag.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,960
They are planning on a massive attack.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,000
And their target is India.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,400
An attack that India never thought of.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,080
It's not a negotiation.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,360
It's ultimate.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,600
And your time starts...

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
now.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
So now?

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,720
Now the time for the revolution is over.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,360
The party will be kept at the revolution house.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,520
The revolution will come for you to die.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
The revolution will come for you.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,920
And the revolution will come for you.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,960
I am a soldier, Patan. Like you.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,720
We can do this mission together.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,000
So are you in? Or are you out?

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,280
A single number of severed lives

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,960
will be the result of a moment in time

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,680
before the revolution comes down.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,360
Patan, the hundred...

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,400
hundred?

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Let's go.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,040
Say my last salute to your mother India.

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,480
A soldier doesn't ask what the country did for him.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,720
He asks what the country can do for him.

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Jai Hind.
