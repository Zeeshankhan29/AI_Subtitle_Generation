1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I know that this road has been very hard.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And yet here you are, building this magnificent family.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's going on in that head of yours?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Something little beast that I...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I said, dad, they're not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I am.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm afraid of losing someone I love.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dominic Toretto.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're about to learn all about fear.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Boom!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You built such a beautiful life filled with love and family.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I never got that chance.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You stole that from me.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My future.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My family.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And now, I'm gonna break yours.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Peace by peace.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He's coming through you with everything.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What's the plan, Dom?

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure anymore.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One of us might not come back from this.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But we have to fight.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Never accept death.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When suffering is owed.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's coming!

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All the dangerous.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ain't too many good things with us.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Labour loves no glorious.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is setup.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He's trying to tear us apart.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Constituation is fight one.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's one of you?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I got one.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When it used to be about winning,

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we raised for respect.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Today, I raised to stop the bloodbath.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's the problem with having such a big family.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How do you choose the ones you save?

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's race!

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You still know how to drive?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What do you think?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's showtime!

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Here we go!

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Game recognizes game.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm coming for you, son.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Here they come.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You will never be able to break my family.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No!

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Good morning, sunshine.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You gotta be kidding me.
